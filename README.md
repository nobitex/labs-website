### `add new document`
if you want to add new document you should put it in this directory

├── src
│   ├── markdown

*warning*  when you add your mark down file  should put number before it like this 1-markdown.md

*warning*  added number should be grater than last number in folder for example if we have 3-markdown.md you should add 4-markdown.md 

*warning*  all of markdown files should contain a yaml like this:
---
title: changed
description: This is a description of my blog post.
category: ["Zero-Knowledge Proofs"]
date: 26 Aug 2023
---
and if file doesn't contain it project wont work correctly 


### `start`

first Convert data of files in src/markdown to a json file
then Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### ` run build`

first Convert data of files in src/markdown to a json file
then Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
